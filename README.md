 Anomaly detection at scale and its applications
 
 It contains codes demonstrating ML techniques used in industries for detecting anomalies (Supervised techniques)
 
 Also unsupervised deeplearning techniques for anomaly detection 
 
 We have also attached architecture both for Hadoop and cloud architecture which is complete design for data pipleine end - to -end streaming anomaly detection  at scale with big data.
